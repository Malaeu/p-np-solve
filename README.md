# P=NP Solve

This repository is dedicated to the famous P=NP problem in computer science.

## About P=NP

The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer (NP) can also be quickly solved by a computer (P).

- P: Problems that can be solved in polynomial time
- NP: Problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time

If P=NP, it would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm theory, artificial intelligence, and many other fields.

## Today's Work

Today we:
1. Set up GitHub CLI
2. Created this repository
3. Explored the P=NP problem
4. Made our first contribution to theoretical computer science
